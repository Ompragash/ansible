minor_changes:
- Added ``--skeleton`` argument to path to a role or collection skeleton that the new role or collection should be based upon. Else for role, we need to use ``--role-skeleton`` and ``--collection-skeleton`` for collection (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74901).
- Added new collection type ``community`` which supports `Community Collection Template <https://github.com/ansible-collections/collection_template>`_ as a skeleton to initialize a new collection using ``ansible-galaxy`` command. To use run ``ansible-galaxy collection init my_namespace.my_collection --type community`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74684).
